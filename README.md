# Mod Manager Python

A (work-in-progress) fuse-overlayfs Mod Manager application for Bethesda games being made in Qt6 for the purpose of having a native-to-linux mod manager available without the problems of running other mod management software in wine.

## Requirements

These are the packages required from your distribution's package manager

- fuse-overlayfs
- unzip
- unrar
- p7zip

## Running the software

```python main.py```

## Still not done:

- [ ] add option imaga viewer to install dialog
- [ ] add option description to install dialog
- [ ] add installer copy logicreworked group type handling, now every case works ( I think )
- [ ] add installer mod info reading
- [ ] finish mods display in main table
